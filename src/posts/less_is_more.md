Less is more. 

I forgot where I read this but it has really started to make more sense the busier I get. 

We all tend to make our todos as busy as possible, learn 10 things at the same time, juggling many hobbies, 
attending many conferences and barely having time for ourselves. We fill our calendars and make ourselves as 
busy as possible and then we complain how we are so "busy". 

Are we though?

The truth we pretend we are busy with a million different things when we are doing things we **don't want to do** 
and be at places we **don't want to be at**. 

We try to do so much and therefore, achieve so less. So maybe, it's not always about doing as many things as you can but
rather doing things that matters, really matters.
