Less is more. 

I forgot where I read this but it has really started to make more sense the busier I get. 

We all tend to make our calendars as busy as possible, learn 10 things at the same time, juggling multiple hobbies, 
attending a dozen conferences and barely having time for ourselves. We keep ourselves in motion, and then, 
paradoxically, we complain about how “busy” we are. 
Are we though?

The truth is, we pretend to be busy with a million different things when we are doing things we **don't want to do** 
and be at places we **don't want to be at**. 

Adding is easy; subtracting, however, requires intention.

Time is scarce and it's only a waste when we spend it on tasks that aren't truly important. 

We try to do so much and yet achieve so less. So maybe, it's not always about doing as many things as you can but
rather doing things that matters, really matters. 

In pursuit of "more", we unironically find ourselves doing "less."
