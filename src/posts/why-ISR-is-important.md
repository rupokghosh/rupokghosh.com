As you may know, traditional static sites are fast but lack real-time content updates. On the other hand, fully dynamic sites can drastically slow down your performance.

> **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** offers a solution by allowing you to pre-render pages at build time and update them as new data comes in, providing the best of both worlds.

### Why ISR Can Be Useful

- **Performance Boost**: ISR allows you to serve static pages with lightning-fast load times while keeping content fresh.
- **Scalability**: It efficiently handles content-heavy sites by regenerating only the necessary pages, reducing the load on your server.
- **SEO Benefits**: Pre-rendered content ensures that your pages are fully optimized for search engines, enhancing your visibility.

### How to Use ISR

To use ISR, you add the `revalidate` prop to `getStaticProps`. Hereâ€™s an example code snippet taken from the Next.js official documentation:
